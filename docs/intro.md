# Introduction

Follow this site to keep track of my PhD project. Hope you like it! <br>

The PhD project consists of 3 tracks:
* Fundamental experiments on flashback in hydrogen jet flames using a [tube burner](projects/combustor_tube/experiment_1.md).
* Investigation of hydrogen flame flashback in a scaled gas turbine combustor:
  * [scaled FlameSheet combustor](projects/combustor_flamesheet_cyl/experiment_2.md)
  * [quasi 2D FlameSheet combustor](projects/combustor_flamesheet_2d/experiment_3.md)
* Validate and adapt flashback models for hydrogen combustion.
